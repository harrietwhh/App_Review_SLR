# App_Review_SLR
This repository contains supplementary data  for Research Paper: How to Effectively Mine App Reviews Concerning Software Ecosystem? A Survey of Review Characteristics. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review on app review mining from the perspective of the characteristics. This survey was conducted on 167 papers published between 2012 and 2022 and focuses on three phases in app review mining: (a) the 167 papers were thoroughly examined to extract practices for the collection of app reviews; (b) a detailed list of review characteristics was summarized through a key-point investigation; (c) the survey presents common handling and applications for each review characteristic.
